# Lung Cancer Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict lung cancer based on patient data. The model utilizes various medical and demographic features to classify whether a patient is at risk of lung cancer.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw medical data for training.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implementing classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score analysis.
- **User Interface:** Simple UI to input patient data and get predictions.
- **Deployment:** Cloud-based or local deployment for accessibility.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib
- **Model Deployment:** Flask / FastAPI

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lung-cancer-prediction.git
   cd lung-cancer-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Input patient data through the UI or script.
2. Get real-time predictions on lung cancer probability.
3. Analyze model performance and refine with new data.
